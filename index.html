           <br> <br> <br> Today, I will explain how to play the original Candy Crush Saga. <br> <br>
            <b>How To Play:</b> <br> <br>

           <b>Step 1:</b> <br>
            Your goal is to match and eliminate as many as you can. Match three of the same candy in a row, to eliminate them 
            (You just swipe the closest match to eliminate them). You earn points each time you do that. If you don't get enough points, 
            you will lose one of your five lives you have in the beginning. <br> <br>

            <b>Step 2:</b> <br>     
            If you see a candy with strips on it, match it with the same colour, you will crush a whole row. If you see a candy in wrapping paper, 
            match it with the same colour, you will blast a whole bunch of candy. <br> <br> <img src="Candy Crush3.jpg"> <br> <br>

            <b>Step 3:</b> <br>
            Every level has a goal. For example, you might have to get an object all the way to the top of the game board. You can only play 15 levels 
            at a time, so if you want to move to the next set of levels, you can buy Candy Crush Saga tickets or you friends can give you gifts. 
            You can earn boosters in this game, or receieve them as gifts. Boosters can add moves, give you extra lives, etc. <br> <br>

            <b>Step 4:</b> <br>
            <b>Enjoy The Game!</b> <br> <br>
