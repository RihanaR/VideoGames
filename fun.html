                <br>Candy Crush is fun because the more levels you pass, the more fun and exciting it gets. It makes you want you 
                pass each level and keep going, to see what happens next, as it becomes more difficult. It sometimes becomes addicting... <br> <br> 
                There are many different tasks you can do, as you reach higher levels, which makes you less bored, instead of having to do 
                the same thing everytime just to reach higher levels. <br> <br> <img src="Candy Crush8.jpg"> <br> <br> You can try new things in the different versions of Candy Crush, like 
                the Candy Crush Soda, and Candy Crush Jelly, which would be fun for people who love the original Candy Crush Saga. <br> <br> 
                You can also have fun playing Candy Crush with your friends and family, and you can see what position they are on. You can try to beat them
                in the high score. <br> <br>
